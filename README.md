# Data-Augmentation

This exercise was to explore the benefit of data augmentation on the learning performance of the ResNet20 Model on CIFAR10 Image Classification Dataset.

In this assignment various aumentation techniques were explored, like
1. Mixup Augmentation (Process of mixing training examples - both inputs and labels)
2. Cutout Augmentation (A random pixel is selected and a mask is cutout of size K)
3. Standard Augmentation (Horizontal flips and random shifts are applied on the images and zero padded the missing pixels)

The performance of the model has been observed after performing these augmentations
